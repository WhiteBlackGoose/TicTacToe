## TicTacToe

The simple game against a bot that you can't defeat. The algorithm is simple:
we consider all our possible moves and choose the one which never leads to the
user's victory.

Use arrows to set `X`. The bot will be responding by `O`. You will never win,
although it is simple not to lose either.
